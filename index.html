            Swedish music has successfully and indefinitely engrained itself in today's music scene with the country producing some of pop's most prolific producers and singers, but it likely all would have been much, much different without ABBA.<br>

            The quartet made up of Agnetha Faltskog, Bjorn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, ruled the international music market for a decade with the group's European-inspired disco hooking listeners with the act only growing more ambitious with their sounds, arrangements and lyrics. Even as romantic, innergroup tensions put strain on the singers, the results were brilliant pop tracks that boast a deeper, fascinating story. Today, ABBA songs define a golden-age of disco and dance music, but the Stockholm singers represent much more than feel-good floor fillers. Here are the 15 ABBA songs that have undeniably stood the test of time.

            One of the best ABBA songs that represented the underlying love stories circling through the quartet's time together, "One of Us" was written by Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson and inspired by their divorces to their band mates Faltskog and Lyngstad. The single marked a darker shift in the group's later material, while blending uplifting harmonies on the heartbreaking chorus ("One of us is crying / One of us is only / Waiting for a call... / Wishing she had never left at all") to encapsulate the emotional depth baked into the group's history that makes them sound so good.

            You'd be hard pressed to find a better chorus than "Knowing Me Knowing You," which automatically begs to be sung when the drums hit ahead of the mix of power chords, guitar riffs and layered vocal segments (listen up for the "Uh huh," if you've missed it all these years). The song details a breakup years before the divorces before the ABBA members, seemingly becoming an ill-omened moment in the band's fascinating story.

            Perhaps one of the more bizarre cuts in ABBA's discography, "Gimme!" is the epitome of how the Swedish sensations could transform minor chords, hair-raising harmonies and ominous production into pop perfection. The template would set the stage for future spooky-pop hits (Michael Jackson's "Thriller," anyone?) and the song's influence would later be felt with a brilliant sample in Madonna's "Hung Up," the lead single off her 2005 album Confessions on a Dance Floor.

            The opening a cappella of this 1981 single indicated the true musicality of ABBA, with the band nailing the opening (and Bjorn and Benny's voices even featured!) and indicated a fresh way to kick off yet another stomper of a single. Past the aca-incredible intro, "Take a Chance on Me" blends the band's classic sound with unexpected sonic shifts like the jarring-yet-impassioned belts, psychedelic synthesizer moments and reverb-heavy harmonies, making it almost sound like parts of separate songs glued together with the disco magic only ABBA knew how to create.

            From the euphoric opening to lyrics that perfectly encapsulate a youthful bliss, "Dancing Queen" is the masterpiece that's outlasted the disco era to become a standard of modern-day dance music. While there's no doubt that the 1976 classic is an exuberant piece of pop music and can get a room moving by its opening notes, there's an underlying melancholy in the cut too that ultimately speaks more to ABBA's ability to make any topic -- new love, heartbreak, war stories -- have a musical richness to it that went beyond any one note. "Dancing Queen" stands not only as their classic tune, but representative of the depth the Swedish sensations could bring to any song and how the melodies and moods they created in their time together remain just as touching today as they did igniting discos in the '70s and '80s.
